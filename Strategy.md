# Notes:
- Novice traders will often start with high probability trades, thinking that the probabilities are on their side. But that large potential loss must be considered, then though the probability of it occurring is quite small. It is the fat tails that make the high probability trades to more of loss making trades.
  - A trade with a high probability of success and a low probability of loss will hava a relatively low potential return.
  - A trade with low probability of success and a high probability of loss will have a relatively high potential return.
  - High probability options trades always have large risk/reward rations.
  - All options strategies lead to a long-term risk adjusted return near zero.
